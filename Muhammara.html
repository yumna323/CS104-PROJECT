Ingredients:
<li>250g Cooked Red Pepper Flesh (about 3-4 Red bell peppers or 4-5 Paprika peppers)</li>
<li>60g Walnuts (extra for garnish)</li>
<li>60g Breadcrumbs</li>
<li>4 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
<li>4 Tbsp Pomegranate Molasses</li>
<li>1 Tsp Aleppo Pepper</li>
<li>1 Tsp Salt</li>
<li>3/4 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
<li>1/2 Onion</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Tahini</li>
<li>If you'd like to make the Lebanese version, you also need:</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Tomato paste</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Sumac</li>

<br><br>
Directions:
<li>Place a pan over a medium heat, and add your walnuts to the pan</li>
<li>Allow them to heat in the pan while stirring them for 5 minutes until a toasted aroma emerges. Remove from the pan immediately and allow to cool</li>
<li>Add your breadcrumbs to the pan and toast them for 5 minutes until they go a golden brown colour, remove from the pan and allow to cool</li>
<li>Wash your peppers and trim off their stalks, then line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top</li>
<li>Place the peppers on the rack leaving some room around them, then slice an onion in half and add to the rack</li>
<li>Place the baking sheet under your broiler for about 8 minutes, until the top surface of your peppers is burnt. Rotate the peppers until all sides have been charred. You can also do this directly on the flame of a grill or stove</li>
<li>When your peppers have softened completely and are charred all over remove and place in a large bowl. Cover it immediately with plastic wrap and allow it to sit for 15 minutes</li>
<li>After 15 minutes, remove your peppers from the bowl and remove their skin, the open them and remove the core and any seeds</li>
<li>Once the peppers have cooled you can add them and the remaining ingredients to a food processor or blender</li>
<li>Blitz all the ingredients together until the dip forms. This will take about 2 minutes. You can leave it running for as long as you want to get a smoother consistency.</li>
<li>Plate in a bowl, then use a spoon to form a well in the center. Drizzle on some olive oil or pomegranate molasses, and add some Aleppo Pepper or Chopped walnuts for garnish</li>
<li>Serve and Enjoy</li>
